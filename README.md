Intelligent Diet Arrangement System
===================================

IDAS is an Android application for keeping your weight under control. It uses BMI (body mass index) to generate a 7-day menu that contains the required number of calories, carbohydrates, fats, fibers and minerals.

The application formulates constraints regarding the meals and uses [JaCoP](http://jacop.osolpro.com) to solve them.
